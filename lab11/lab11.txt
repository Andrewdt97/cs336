    Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.
    	The production enviornment is optomized for performance while the development has nice features to make updating easier.
    	In the production enviornment, we are uglifying the JS and running other optimizations while the development deployment
    	had the nifty auto reload on modules.

    List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.
    	UglifyJS and OptomizeOccuranceOrderPlugin. The bundle.js is now much more compact (less white space), I don't see where OptomizeOccurranceOrderPlugin
    	has an effect, but it minimizes the id length for modules and chunks.


    What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?
    	You don't have to worry about hosting the server yourself. You get more uptime, CI/CD, professional security, and other benefits.

    How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?
    	The scripts in the package.json!
