It's no secret that college students are busy. Ask around and you will surely find
those who say their responsibilities are filled and their brains are empty. It's okay,
college is a time to be stretched. But what can create issues is when busy college
students, living off campus, cannot find the organization or time to maintain their
dwellings. An unclean living space can be a source of conflict and a general drab on
the mood of college students. A chore chart is often use to organize, communicate, and
bring accountability to the cleaning process, but there are often physical limitations
such as a difficulty to add new items and easily rearrange. That's where a new webapp
comes in. This app would allow of all of the organizational prowess of a chore chart,
with the flexibility and accessibility of a webapp. From school, users can check what
they need to do when they get home and plan accordingly. Users can easily add more
items and rearrange as necessary. And chores can be automatically reassigned after a
given time period or completion status.
