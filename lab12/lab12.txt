What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
It allows us to render different componets based on the url

Which is better, hash history or browser history?
Browser history is more flexible and dynamic, making it better in most cases.

Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.



What state does the new CommentEdit component maintain and how does that compare with the state maintained by the CommentBox component?
It only maintains the state of the author and text. The comment box
contains all the data and the mount status.

What does the CommentEdit component do when the AJAX PUT or DELETE methods return successfully? How does this compare with what the “Cancel” button provided by the CommentEdit component does?
It reroutes to the '/' route when the PUT or DELETE is done. It does the same thing with the Cancel button, but without the data transfer.

How is the Link added in the last step different from a simple HTML hyperlink?
It allows you to go to different parts of your application without requiring you to reload the page.
